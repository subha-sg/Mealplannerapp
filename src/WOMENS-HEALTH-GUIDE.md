### Postpartum Recovery (0-6 months after delivery)

**The Fourth Trimester - Critical Recovery Period**

**Nutritional Priorities:**

**3. Bone Health Protection**

## 🌸 Menopause (Age 50+)

**Understanding Menopause:**
Defined as 12 consecutive months without a period. Average age in India: 46-48 years.

**Post-Menopause Phase:**
Estrogen remains low permanently, requiring lifelong nutritional adaptation.

**Health Risks to Address:**

**1. Osteoporosis (Bone Loss)**
**The Risk:**
- Women can lose up to 20% of bone density in 5-7 years after menopause
- 1 in 3 women over 50 will experience osteoporotic fractures

**Prevention Through Diet:**
- **Calcium**: 1200mg daily
  - 3 servings dairy or equivalents
  - Ragi, sesame seeds (til), amaranth (rajgira)
  - Fortified plant milks

- **Vitamin D**: 800-1000 IU daily
  - Sunlight exposure (15-20 min)
  - Fortified foods, fatty fish
  - Supplements often needed

- **Protein**: 1-1.2g per kg body weight
  - Prevents muscle loss which protects bones
  - Dal, paneer, eggs, Greek yogurt

- **Limit**: Salt, caffeine, carbonated drinks (increase calcium loss)

**2. Cardiovascular Health**
**The Risk:**
- Heart disease risk equals men after menopause
- Estrogen loss affects cholesterol levels

**Heart-Healthy Eating:**
- **Fiber**: 25-30g daily
  - Oats, barley, vegetables, fruits, whole grains
  - Lowers cholesterol

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**:
  - Walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds
  - Fish (salmon, mackerel)
  - Reduces inflammation

- **Limit**:

  - Trans fats (packaged foods)
  - Sodium (max 2300mg/day)

**3. Weight Management**
**The Challenge:**
- Metabolism slows 2-5% per decade
- Shift in fat distribution to abdomen
- Muscle mass decreases

**Strategy:**
- **Never skip breakfast**: Kickstarts metabolism
- **Protein at every meal**: Preserves muscle
- **Smaller, frequent meals**: 5-6 times/day
- **Hydration**: 8-10 glasses water
- **Mindful eating**: Avoid emotional eating

**Sample Plate**:
- 1/2 plate: Vegetables
- 1/4 plate: Protein (dal, paneer, lean meat)
- 1/4 plate: Complex carbs (millet, brown rice)

**4. Cognitive Health**
**Support Brain Function:**
- **Antioxidants**: Berries, nuts, dark chocolate
- **Omega-3**: Brain health and memory
- **B Vitamins**: B6, B12, folate
- **Hydration**: Dehydration affects cognition

**Mediterranean-Indian Fusion Diet:**
Best researched diet for aging women:
- Abundant vegetables and fruits
- Whole grains (millets, brown rice)
- Healthy fats (olive oil, nuts)
- Lean protein
- Limited red meat
- Herbs and spices (turmeric, ginger)

**5. Digestive Health**
**Common Issues:**

- Bloating

**Solutions:**
- **Fiber**: Gradually increase to 25-30g
- **Probiotics**: Yogurt, buttermilk, fermented foods
- **Digestive spices**: Ginger, cumin, fennel, ajwain
- **Hydration**: Critical for fiber to work

**6. Joint Health**
