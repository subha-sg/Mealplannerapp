## Purpose & Mission

Shakti Aahaar is a comprehensive meal planning application specifically designed for **Indian women and children**, addressing critical nutritional needs throughout different life stages:

### 🤰 Pregnancy & Postpartum Recovery
Women need **50-100% more iron** and **calcium** during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Our app highlights:

### 💪 Menopause & Beyond (Age 50+)
Post-menopause, women face:
- **200% increased risk** of osteoporosis - requiring high calcium intake
